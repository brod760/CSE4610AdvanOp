Project Part 1: The first part of the project requires the implementation of class that will be used to simulate a disk drive. 

Project Part 2: The second part of the project requires the implementation of a simple file system. In particular, it should include software which will handle dynamic file management.

Project Part 3: The third part of the project requires the implementation of a simple shell that uses the file system.
